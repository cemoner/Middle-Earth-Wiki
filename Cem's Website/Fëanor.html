            <p id = "top">Fëanor was a Ñoldorin elf and one of the Elven kindred that departed from Valinor in the land of Aman, where they had lived with the Valar.

                He was born in Valinor, the only child of Finwë, High King of the Ñoldor, 
                and Finwë's first wife Míriel Therindë. He was a craftsman, 
                gem-smith, and warrior, the maker of the Silmarils and inventor of 
                the Tengwar script. He also created the Palantíri.  
                Fëanor was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind; 
                countenance, understanding, skill, and subtlety, of all the Children of Ilúvatar.
                 However, in his personality came flaws, foremost among them selfishness and pride,
                  and at a time these would bring anguish and turmoil to his people.</p>

            <h1>Biography:</h1>
            <p>
                Fëanor was born during the Years of the Trees in Valinor.
                When he was born, he drew so much of Míriel's life energy
                when he was born that she grew weary of living and her
                spirit voluntarily left her body, leaving her family
                for the Halls of Mandos. After a time, Finwë remarried
                and had four more children; Fëanor's half-brothers
                Fingolfin and Finarfin, and half-sisters Findis and Irimë.
                Though he loved his father as dearly as a son could, Fëanor
                was not fond of his stepmother Indis nor her children
                , and so lived apart from her and his half-siblings.
                 In his youth, he quickly discovered his outstanding talents for craftsmanship
                and language. In his youth, he improved upon the work of Rúmil and created
                the system of writing known as Tengwar, used by the Noldor in Middle-Earth
                until the Third Age. He also became a student of Mahtan, a great smith who
                had learned his craft at the feet of Aulë himself. From Mahtan, he learned
                much of metallurgy, and at some point he wedded Mahtan's daughter Nerdanel,
                who bore him seven sons: Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod,
                and Amras. He spent most of his time either alone or with his sons, 
                and they were all completely loyal to him. He also was known to have
                been restless, exploring as much of Aman as he could and constantly
                crafting new works.
