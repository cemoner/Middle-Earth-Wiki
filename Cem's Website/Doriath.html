                The Vanyar and Ñoldor had passed by it on the Great Journey, and had been ferried across on 
                Tol Eressëa by the time the Teleri arrived. Then their lord Elwë was lost in Nan Elmoth, and 
                when Ulmo returned for them, a part remained behind. They became known as the Sindar 
                or Grey Elves, and when Thingol returned he became their king, ruling from Doriath.
                The forests of Neldoreth and Region were located in the center of Beleriand, and 
                were the abode of King Thingol and Melian. Their people were the people of the 
                Teleri who did not heed the call of the Valar to pass over the sea to Valinor. 
                All the Elves of Beleriand, from the shipbuilders under Círdan in the Falas, to 
                the hunters of the Blue Mountains, held Thingol as their lord.
                <p id = "topalt">
                  During the First 
                  and Second Ages of the Chaining of Melkor, Beleriand was peaceful. However, by 
                  the end of the First Age, Melian forebode that evil was to come, and Thingol 
                  called on the aid of the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in constructing a city-fortress 
                  for the protection of his people. They also helped make for them a store of stronger 
                  and better weapons that were better able to deal with the Orcs of north. This 
                  was built under ground along the southern side of the River Esgalduin, and was 
                  called Menegroth, which became Thingol's capital.
                  For the most part, the Elves lived in scattered bands throughout Beleriand, 
                  only gathering in larger numbers in Neldoreth and Region (together called Eglador), 
                  and along the Falas. During the Third Age of the Chaining of Melkor, Thingol 
                  proceeded to arm his people with the aid of the Dwarves of Nogrod and 
                  Belegost against the continued foreboding of Melian.
                  After Melkor's release, his attack on the Two Trees with Ungoliant, and 
                  flight to Middle-earth, the situation for Beleriand suddenly worsened. 
                  Ungoliant fled south from the Balrogs after her confrontation with Melkor, 
                  now Morgoth, and was only checked by the power of Melian. Some time after, 
                  the forces of Morgoth left the freshly delved Angband and assaulted Beleriand 
                  from east and west in the First Battle of Beleriand. In the east, King Thingol 
                  lead the forces of Beleriand, with the aid of Denethor and his Nandor and elves 
                  from Ossiriand, and completely defeated the Orcs of the eastern army. Denethor 
                  was killed on Amon Ereb, and some of his people merged themselves to the Sindarin 
                  Elves under King Thingol. Upon returning to Menegroth, Thingol learned that the 
                  western army of Morgoth had overrun the Falas. Thingol recalled as many of his 
                  people he could into Neldoreth and Region, and Melian put forth her power, 
                  ringing the region in a girdle of enchantment called the Girdle of Melian. Thus, 
                  the region formally called Eglador came to be formally known as Doriath, the Guarded Kingdom.
                  The First Battle is the only time King Thingol led his forces into battle outside 
                  of his realm in the entirety of the First Age of the Sun. Afterwards, the Elves 
                  of Doriath fought defensively, guarding their borders and the important river 
                  crossings nearby.
