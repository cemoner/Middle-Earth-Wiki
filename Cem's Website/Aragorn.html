                "I am Aragorn son of Arathorn, and am called Elessar, 
                the Elfstone, Dúnadan, the heir of Isildur Elendil's son of Gondor. 
                Here is the sword that was broken and is forged again! " —Aragorn, speaking to Éomer 
                in The Two Towers, The Riders of Rohan Aragorn II, son of Arathorn II 
                and Gilraen, also known as Elessar and Strider, was the 16th Chieftain of 
                the Dúnedain of the North; later crowned King Elessar Telcontar 
                (March 1, 2931 - FO 120 or SR 1541), the 26th King of Arnor and 35th King 
                of Gondor - and first High King of Gondor and Arnor since the short reign 
                of Isildur. He was a great ranger and warrior, and as Isildur's heir 
                he bore the shards of Narsil, reforged and renamed Andúril, Flame of the West, 
                in the War of the Ring.</p>

            <br>
            <p id = "topalt">
                Aragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur. His ancestor Arvedui was wedded to Fíriel, 
                who was descended from Anárion, who bore their son Aranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant 
                of Anárion as well.When he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing 
                orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond. At the request of his mother, 
                his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather 
                if his true identity as the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn was 
                renamed "Estel" and was not told about his heritage until 2951.Elrond revealed to "Estel" his 
                true name and ancestry when he was twenty, and gave to him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards 
                of Narsil. Elrond withheld the Sceptre of Annúminas from Aragorn until he "came of the right" 
                to possess the item. It was also around this time that Aragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, 
                Elrond's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of Lórien where she had visited her 
                grandmother Galadriel.Aragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of the 
                Dúnedain and the Rangers of the North, and left the comforts of Rivendell for the wild, where 
                he lived with the remainder of his people, whose kingdom had been destroyed through civil and regional wars centuries before.
                Aragorn met Gandalf the Grey in 2956 and they became close friends. Heeding Gandalf's advice, 
                Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the Shire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian Hobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Shire's borders as Strider. 
                From TA 2957 to TA 2980, Aragorn undertook great journeys, serving in the armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the growing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he earned priceless experience which he would later put to use in the War of the Ring. Aragorn served his lords in disguise and his name in Gondor and Rohan during that time was Thorongil ("Eagle of the Star"). With a small Gondor squadron of ships, he led an assault on the long-standing Corsair province of Umbar in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and personally slaying their lord during the battle on the Havens. After the victory at Umbar, "Thorongil" left Gondor and, to the dismay of his men, went east.
