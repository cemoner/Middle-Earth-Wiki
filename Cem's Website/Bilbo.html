                "If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a
                 merrier world." —Thorin, to (and about) Bilbo.
                <br>
                <br>
                Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a 
                secondary character in The Lord of the Rings.
                Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their 
                burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. 
                Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and the first to voluntarily 
                give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.
                Bilbo was the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and one of 
                the few to set foot in the Undying Lands.</p>

            <p id = "topalt">
                Bilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 
                12-14 of our calendar), in the year 2890 of the Third Age. He was the only 
                son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.
                In Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious Hobbit-hole 
                for Belladonna, which they named Bag End. The family moved to their new home, 
                where Bilbo would spend much of his life.
                As a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world. 
                The Istar wizard, Gandalf, took interest in this unusual quality in Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later remember Gandalf's Firework displays in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great Smials. Bilbo apparently practiced his rock-throwing skills in his youth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he bent down to pick up a rock.
                When Bilbo's father and mother died in TA 2926 and TA 2934 respectively, 
                Bilbo became his own master and spent the next seven years living alone in 
                Bag End. During this time, Bilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy bachelor 
                and acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors admired.
                In the year TA 2941, Bilbo, at the age of 51, was visited by Gandalf, whom he 
                had not seen for quite some time, outside his home at Bag End. Gandalf invited 
                Bilbo on an unspecified adventure, which was flatly refused by the hobbit, who 
                bade the wizard a "Good morning", and went inside.
                Undeterred, Gandalf continued in his plan, sending thirteen dwarves, led by 
                Thorin Oakenshield, to Bag End the very day. These dwarves, needing an 
                additionally member for their company, initially came by pairs, and lastly 
                with Gandalf, who had himself selected Bilbo as the best person for the dwarves'
                job. The dwarves explained to Bilbo their background and purpose; that they 
                were among the Dwarves of Erebor who had been forced from the Lonely Mountain 
                when the dragon Smaug attacked and taken up residence there. They now had 
                determined to reclaim the mountain and needed a "burglar" to help them in 
                situations requiring stealth. Bilbo reluctantly agreed to go, and the next 
                morning they set off from The Green Dragon Inn. Thorin's Company traverses the Lone-lands 
                Thorin and company traveled through the Lone-lands along high hills and beside castles. 
                After approximately one month since their outset, Gandalf disappeared. Óin and Glóin 
                failed to make a fire during a rainy night, and Balin spotted a fire in the distance, 
                which was rare in those regions, and sent Bilbo to investigate. At the fire were three 
                Stone-trolls, Tom, Bert, and William. Bilbo attempted to snatch something from the trolls 
                to bring back to the Dwarves, to show that he was a first-class burglar. However, he was 
                caught by William, but he escaped and was helpless to prevent all the dwarves from being 
                captured when they came looking for him. Fortunately for the dwarves, Gandalf returned 
                and saved them all by imitating the trolls' voices and tricking the trolls into arguing 
                with one another until daybreak, which turned them all to stone. After rescuing the 
                party, the wizard led Bilbo and the party to the trolls' cave, which the trolls had 
                used to hide their treasure and shield themselves from the sun during the daylight hours. 
                In the cave, a number of weapons were found, Glamdring (Beater) and Orcrist (Biter) among them. 
                Bilbo took an Elvish dagger from the trolls' collection, no longer than a small knife in size, 
                which he would later name Sting. He kept it with him for the rest of his adventure, wearing it 
                inside his breeches.(Read The Hobbit for More)
