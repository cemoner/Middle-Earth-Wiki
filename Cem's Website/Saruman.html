                    Saruman (Quenya; IPA: ['saruman] - "Man Of Skill"), also known as Saruman the White was the 
                    first of the order of Istar (wizard), who came to Middle-earth as Emissaries of the Valar 
                    in the Third Age. He also was the leader of the wizards and of the White Council that 
                    opposed Sauron. His extensive studies of dark magic, however, eventually led him to desire 
                    the One Ring. Thinking he could gain it for himself or become Sauron's servant alone, 
                    Saruman allied Isengard with Mordor in the War of the Ring, in which he was defeated.
                    He studied deeply the arts of Sauron, the better to intially oppose him, but he soon 
                    became enamored of the Dark Lord's devices, especially the One Ring. He betrayed his 
                    mission and came to view the future of Middle-earth under his or Sauron's dominion. 
                    While coveting the Ring, Saruman kept the pretense of allegiance to the Enemy. But his 
                    plans came to nought, and his power was broken in the Battle of the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard.
                    Before his fall, he was the chief of both the wizards and of the White Council 
                    (a league of all those opposed to Sauron). His knowledge and skill, especially 
                    of Sauron's devices, was said to be great. However, his deep study of the Rings 
                    of Power and Sauron's other magic corrupted him, and his overweening lust for power 
                    led to his downfall. Though not truly faithful to his master, Saruman unintentionally 
                    fell deeper under Sauron's sway by delving into Ring-lore and betraying the Valar. 
                    He is one of the few characters in Middle-earth who is morally "grey" - being 
                    neither a genuine servant of evil nor an agent of good. He ultimately trusts only 
                    his own counsel and schemes for his own ends.
