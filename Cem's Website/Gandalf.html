                <br>
                <br>
                Gandalf (Norse; IPA: [gand:alf] - "Elf of the Wand" or "Wand-elf") the Grey, later known as 
                Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin] - "Dreamer" or "Of Dreams"), 
                was an Istar (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. 
                He joined Thorin and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, convoked the Fellowship 
                of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, 
                and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.</p>

                <p id = "topalt">
                    Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar 
                    (with the possible exception of Melian). He was created by Ilúvatar before 
                    the Music of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur 
                    who entered into Eä. In his "youth", he became one of the Maiar who served 
                    Manwë, Varda, Irmo and Nienna named. He was associated with light and fire, 
                    much like his peer Varda. Yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from 
                    whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but he walked unseen 
                    among them, or wore a fana that appeared like an Elf, and sent them fair visions 
                    in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his existence, he followed the 
                    example of Nienna, he took pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and 
                    drove those who listened to him out of despair.
                    When the Valar decided to send the order of the Istari (also known as Wizards) 
                    to Middle-earth, to counsel and assist all those who opposed the Dark 
                    Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda decided to include Olórin among the five 
                    who were sent. At first, Olórin was nervous and described himself as 
                    too weak and too afraid of Sauron. Manwë understood, and told him that 
                    was one main reason why he should go - to overcome that fear. Furthermore, 
                    the One Ring, which held much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed 
                    somewhere. Thus, Manwë insisted that Olórin should go as the third, but 
                    Varda convinced him to have Olórin go as the second instead. He agreed, 
                    and prepared for his departure from the Undying Lands with the other four, 
                    arriving about the same time the Necromancer appeared in Mirkwood.
