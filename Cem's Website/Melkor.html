                Melkor (Quenya; IPA: "He who arises in might"), later known predominantly as Morgoth 
                (Sindarin; IPA: "Black Foe of the World"), was the first Dark Lord, and the primordial 
                source of evil in Eä. Originally the most powerful of the Ainur created by Eru Ilúvatar, 
                Melkor rebelled against his creator out of pride and sought to corrupt Arda. After 
                committing many evils in the First Age, such as the theft of the Silmarils, which 
                resulted in his name Morgoth, and the destruction of the Two Lamps and the Two 
                Trees of Valinor, Morgoth was defeated by the Host of Valinor in the War of Wrath. 
                As punishment he was cast out of Arda into the Void, though it was prophesied he 
                would one day return.

            <p id = "topalt">
                He was created by Eru Ilúvatar in the Timeless Halls at the beginning of creation. His brother was 
                Manwë, though his was greater in power and knowledge than any of the Ainur. 
                Impatient with the emptiness of the Great Void outside the Timeless Halls, and desiring 
                to create things of his own, he often went forth into the Void in search of the 
                Flame Imperishable. But the Flame was of Ilúvatar and resided with him, and Melkor 
                never discovered it. He continued to search, however, and as such was often alone 
                and apart from his fellow Ainur. It was during these lonesome periods that he began 
                to have ideas and thoughts of his own that were not in accordance with his fellow Ainur.
                When the Ainur sang the Great Music before Eru, he wove some of these alien thoughts 
                into his music, and straightaway Discord arose around him. Some of those nearby attuned 
                their music to his, until two musical themes were warring before the Throne. To correct 
                the Discord, Eru introduced a Second, and then a Third Theme into the music. But Melkor 
                succeeded in holding back the Second theme, of which Manwë was the chief instrument. The 
                Third was the theme of Elves and Men, and while it was not overwhelmed by the Discord 
                as the Second theme was, it too failed to correct it. When Eru brought the Music to an 
                end, he rebuked Melkor, praising his strength but reminding him that, as an aspect of 
                his creator's thought, anything that he could bring into being ultimately had its 
                source within Eru himself. As such, even the Discord redounded in the end to the glory 
                of Eru's work. This rebuke shamed Melkor, but brought on anger in him as well, though he 
                hid it. Thus when the Music was made incarnate as Arda, it was already flawed through the 
                Discord, and immoderate heat and great cold stalked it. 
                Melkor then took in the interest of the World and descended to it with the other Valar.
