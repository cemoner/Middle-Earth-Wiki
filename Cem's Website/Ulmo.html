                Ulmo (Quenya; IPA: [ˈulmo] - "Pourer" or "Rainer") - also known as Ulubôz or Ullubôz - was an Ainu, 
                one of the Aratar, and the Vala responsible for the control over the oceans of Arda. A 
                lover of water, Ulmo was one of the Arda's chief architects and was always in a close 
                friendship with Manwë. He always distrusted Melkor, and the Dark Lord feared the Sea 
                almost as much as he feared Varda because the sea cannot be tamed. Ulmo had no dwelling 
                in Valinor or any permanent dwelling on land, as he preferred the deeps of the seas and the rivers. 
                His palace, on the bottom of Vaiya, was called Ulmonan.

            <p id = "topalt">
                Ulmo seldom came to the Councils of Máhanaxar, and only when in great need. 
                He preferred to stay in Arda, not by walking on the land, as his form 
                would fill man or elf with great dread. All waters were under his 
                government: bays, rivers and even the waters under the earth. 
                Where the power of Morgoth was strong, however, Ulmo's own power would be 
                sapped from waters near to Morgoth's corruption. It is through the rivers 
                that he kept in touch with Arda, and thus knew more of the goings on with 
                the Children of Ilúvatar than even Manwë, for in that way he lived in the 
                very veins of the world. His visible form caused fear in mortals and even the 
                Elves. In the Fall of Gondolin he was described as having a tall crown like 
                silver, and his hair was like shimmering sea foam. He wore a grey cloak which 
                appeared as a mist veiling a coat of mail which glittered like fish scales 
                flickering green. And the horns he blew were called the Ulumúri.
                Ulmo always loved the Eldar and the Edain, even when the Valar forsook Middle-earth. 
                He opposed Oromë's plan to bring the elves to Aman, but helped those that were 
                willing to reach it. He uprooted a large island which was later known as Tol 
                Eressëa and used it to ferry them across the Belegaer to the Blessed Realm. 
                Afterwards, he anchored it in the Bay of Eldamar, which he did because he knew 
                the minds of the Teleri. Ulmo was the Vala most responsible for the fall of 
                Morgoth, by urging Turgon to build Gondolin and Finrod to build Nargothrond 
                (FA 50). He appeared before Tuor and urged him to go to Gondolin as a messenger 
                to Turgon. When he got there, he eventually married Turgon's daughter Idril and 
                fathered Eärendil. Ulmo saved Eärendil's wife Elwing from the sack of the Havens 
                of Sirion, allowing her to take a Silmaril to her husband, which allowed him to 
                gain admittance to Valinor and plead for aid. Ulmo also defended them in the 
                council from the potential wrath of Mandos.
